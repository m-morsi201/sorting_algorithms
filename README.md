This is "0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O" project.
I am expected to be able to explain the following without the help of Google:

1. At least four different sorting algorithms.
2. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
4. What is a stable sorting algorithm.
